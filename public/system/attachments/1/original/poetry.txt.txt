How do I opine
On a wine
I ne'r tasted


I thought a thought,
An empty thought,
It was beautiful and sublime.

Alas this rhyme,
Engrossed my mind,
And strangled this emptiness of mine.

It would seem to me 
that I've already thought;
All the thoughts 
that needed to be thought;
Good thoughts, 
bad thoughts, 
big thoughts, 
tiny thoughts;
Such a tragedy t'is then 
that them I've forgot. 
And so I think thoughts 
I've already thought;
And so I think thoughts 
I thought I've not.
