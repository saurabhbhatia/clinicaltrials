# Index as a Block

If you want to fully customize the display of your resources on the index
screen, Index as a Block allows you to render a block of content for each
resource.

    index :as => :block do |product|
      div :for => product do
        h2 auto_link(product.title)
        div do
          simple_format product.description
        end
      end
    end
