# Sidebar Sections

To add a sidebar section to all the screen within a section, use the sidebar method:

    sidebar :help do
      "Need help? Email us at help@example.com"
    end

This will generate a sidebar section on each screen of the resource. With the block as
the contents of the section. The first argument is the section title.

You can also use Arbre syntax to define the content.

    sidebar :help do
      ul do
        li "Second List First Item"
        li "Second List Second Item"
      end
    end

Sidebar sections can be rendered on a specific action by using the :only or :except
options.

    sidebar :help, :only => :index do
      "Need help? Email us at help@example.com"
    end

If you only pass a symbol, Active Admin will attempt to locate a partial to render.

    # Will render app/views/admin/posts/_help_sidebar.html.erb
    sidebar :help

Or you can pass your own custom partial to render.

    sidebar :help, :partial => "custom_help_partial"
