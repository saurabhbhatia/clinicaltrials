    # = Index as a Table
    #
    # By default, the index page is a table with each of the models content columns and links to
    # show, edit and delete the object. There are many ways to customize what gets
    # displayed.
    #
    # == Defining Columns
    #
    # To display an attribute or a method on a resource, simply pass a symbol into the
    # column method:
    #
    #     index do
    #       column :title
    #     end
    #
    # If the default title does not work for you, pass it as the first argument:
    #
    #     index do
    #       column "My Custom Title", :title
    #     end
    #
    # Sometimes calling methods just isn't enough and you need to write some view
    # specific code. For example, say we wanted a colum called Title which holds a
    # link to the posts admin screen.
    #
    # The column method accepts a block as an argument which will then be rendered
    # within the context of the view for each of the objects in the collection.
    #
    #     index do
    #       column "Title" do |post|
    #         link_to post.title, admin_post_path(post)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # The block gets called once for each resource in the collection. The resource gets passed into
    # the block as an argument.
    #
    # To setup links to View, Edit and Delete a resource, use the default_actions method:
    #
    #     index do
    #       column :title
    #       default_actions
    #     end
    #
    # Alternatively, you can create a column with custom links:
    #
    #     index do
    #       column :title
    #       column "Actions" do |post|
    #         link_to "View", admin_post_path(post)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    #
    # == Sorting
    #
    # When a column is generated from an Active Record attribute, the table is
    # sortable by default. If you are creating a custom column, you may need to give
    # Active Admin a hint for how to sort the table.
    #
    # If a column is defined using a block, you must pass the key to turn on sorting. The key
    # is the attribute which gets used to sort objects using Active Record.
    #
    #     index do
    #       column "Title", :sortable => :title do |post|
    #         link_to post.title, admin_post_path(post)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # You can turn off sorting on any column by passing false:
    #
    #     index do
    #       column :title, :sortable => false
    #     end
    #
    # == Showing and Hiding Columns
    #
    # The entire index block is rendered within the context of the view, so you can
    # easily do things that show or hide columns based on the current context.
    #
    # For example, if you were using CanCan:
    #
    #     index do
    #       column :title, :sortable => false
    #       if can? :manage, Post
    #         column :some_secret_data
    #       end
    #     end
    #
