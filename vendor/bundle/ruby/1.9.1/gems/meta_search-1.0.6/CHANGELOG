Changes since 1.0.4 (2011-04-08):
  * Add :join_type option to Builder to allow for using InnerJoin if desired
    (Stephen Pike)
  * Fix a memory leak in development mode (Bonias)

Changes since 1.0.3 (2011-03-14):
  * Be sure not to override form_for options if super returns a non-true value,
    fixes a compatibility issue when using client_side_validation

Changes since 1.0.1 (2011-01-18):
  * Include all non-boolean types in is_present and is_blank, to match
    documentation
  * Avoid setting alias to collection_check_boxes and check_boxes against
    the base. Fixes issues with SimpleForm compatibility.
  * Delegate page method to relation, for Kaminari support.
  * Don't check for existence of attributes if the table doesn't exist yet.

Changes since 1.0.0 (2011-01-17):
  * Update polymorphic join support to play nicely with MetaWhere

Changes since 0.9.11 (2011-01-06):
  * Doc updates only.

Changes since 0.9.10 (2010-11-18):
  * Skip attempts to sort if someone passes an empty string to meta_sort
  * Allow conditions on search_methods, (attr|assoc)_(un)?searchable using :if.
    Option should be an object that responds to call and accepts the
    MetaSearch::Builder instance as a parameter. Unused options passed to the
    Model.search method will be available for your conditions to act on.
  * Access attribute setters if a param is supplied - @search.attr_name(val)
    behaves like @search.attr_name = val

Changes since 0.9.9 (2010-11-15):
  * Fix bug introduced by new polymorphic belongs_to association code in
    honoring :url param to form_for
  * Support localization of predicate text in labels
  * Fix bug when accessing localizations for named search methods

Changes since 0.9.8 (2010-10-20):
  * ARel 2.x and Rails 3.0.2 compatability
  * sort_link uses search_key from builder. Search_key defaults to "search"
  * sort_link will localize attribute names.
  * You can now create two scopes on your model named sort_by_something_asc
    and sort_by_something_desc, and sort_link will then allow you to specify
    :something as a parameter, then use your scope to perform custom sorting.

Changes since 0.9.7 (2010-10-12):
  * Play nicely regardless of MetaWhere/MetaSearch load order.
  * Big fix - stop altering the supplied hash in Builder#build.

Changes since 0.9.6 (2010-09-29):
  * Support _or_-separated conditions. I'm not crazy about 'em, but it's
    an oft-requested feature.
  * Support search on polymorphic belongs_to associations. Uses the same
    syntax users of Searchlogic are familiar with, association_classname_type.
    For example: commentable_article_type_contains
  * Join using left outer joins instead of inner joins. This lets you do
    some interesting things like search for all articles with no comments via
    comments_id_is_null.
  * No longer define method on the metaclass - stick to standard method_missing
    for both correctness and performance.

Changes since 0.9.5 (2010-09-28):
  * Fix issue with formatters supplied as strings

Changes since 0.9.4 (2010-09-18):
  * Rename check_boxes and collection_check_boxes to checks and
    collection_checks. Alias to the old names if not already taken. This
    is to avoid conflicts with SimpleForm.

Changes since 0.9.3 (2010-09-08):
  * Minor documentation fixes.
  * Add sort_link helper to FormBuilder, to spare keystrokes if sort_links
    are being added inside the context of the form_for of the search.

Changes since 0.9.2 (2010-08-25):
  * Update dependencies for Rails 3 final.

Changes since 0.9.1 (2010-08-24):
  * Fix time column casts to account for current time zone.

Changes since 0.9.0 (2010-08-24):
  * Fix the missing "2" in the Rails 3.0.0.rc2 dependency. Sorry!

Changes since 0.5.4 (2010-07-28):
  * Fix equals Where against boolean columns
  * Add is_true/is_false for booleans, is_present/is_blank for other types
  * Add is_null/is_not_null for all types
  * Remove deprecated metasearch_exclude_attr and friends
  * delegate #size and #length to relation

Changes since 0.5.3 (2010-07-26):
  * Add is_true/is_false for boolean columns
  * Add is_present and is_blank for string/numeric columns
  * Add is_null and is_not_null for all columns
  * Fix behavior of equals when used with boolean columns.

Changes since 0.5.2 (2010-07-22):
  * Handle nested/namespaced form_for better. Formerly, you could use
    "form_for @search" in a view, but not "form_for [:admin, @search]"

Changes since 0.5.1 (2010-07-20):
  * Fix fallback for failed cast via to_time or to_date
  * add :cast option for custom Wheres, allowing a where to override
    the default cast of the incoming parameters.

Changes since 0.5.0 (2010-06-08):
  * Fix searching against relations derived from a has_many :through
    association
