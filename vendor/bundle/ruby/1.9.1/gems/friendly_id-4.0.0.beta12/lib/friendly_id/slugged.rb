require "friendly_id/slug_generator"

module FriendlyId
=begin
This module adds in-table slugs to a model.

Slugs are unique id strings that have been processed to remove or replace
characters that a developer considers inconvenient for use in URLs. For example,
blog applications typically use a post title to provide the basis of a search
engine friendly URL:

    "Gone With The Wind" -> "gone-with-the-wind"

FriendlyId generates slugs from a method or column that you specify, and stores
them in a field in your model. By default, this field must be named +:slug+,
though you may change this using the
{FriendlyId::Slugged::Configuration#slug_column slug_column} configuration
option. You should add an index to this field. You may also wish to constrain it
to NOT NULL, but this depends on your app's behavior and requirements.

=== Example Setup

    # your model
    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend FriendlyId
      friendly_id :title, :use => :slugged
      validates_presence_of :title, :slug, :body
    end

    # a migration
    class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        create_table :posts do |t|
          t.string :title, :null => false
          t.string :slug, :null => false
          t.text :body
        end

        add_index :posts, :slug, :unique => true
      end

      def self.down
        drop_table :posts
      end
    end

=== Slug Format

By default, FriendlyId uses Active Support's
paramaterize[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-parameterize]
method to create slugs. This method will intelligently replace spaces with
dashes, and Unicode Latin characters with ASCII approximations:

  movie = Movie.create! :title => "Der Preis fürs Überleben"
  movie.slug #=> "der-preis-furs-uberleben"

==== Slug Uniqueness

When you try to insert a record that would generate a duplicate friendly id,
FriendlyId will append a sequence to the generated slug to ensure uniqueness:

  car = Car.create :title => "Peugot 206"
  car2 = Car.create :title => "Peugot 206"

  car.friendly_id #=> "peugot-206"
  car2.friendly_id #=> "peugot-206--2"

==== Changing the Slug Sequence Separator

You can do this with the {Slugged::Configuration#sequence_separator
sequence_separator} configuration option.

==== Column or Method?

FriendlyId always uses a method as the basis of the slug text - not a column. It
first glance, this may sound confusing, but remember that Active Record provides
methods for each column in a model's associated table, and that's what
FriendlyId uses.

Here's an example of a class that uses a custom method to generate the slug:

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    friendly_id :name_and_location
    def name_and_location
      "#{name} from #{location}"
    end
  end

  bob = Person.create! :name => "Bob Smith", :location => "New York City"
  bob.friendly_id #=> "bob-smith-from-new-york-city"

==== Providing Your Own Slug Processing Method

You can override {Slugged#normalize_friendly_id} in your model for total
control over the slug format.

==== Deciding when to generate new slugs

Overriding {Slugged#should_generate_new_friendly_id?} lets you control whether
new friendly ids are created when a model is updated. For example, if you only
want to generate slugs once and then treat them as read-only:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    extend FriendlyId
    friendly_id :title, :use => :slugged

    def should_generate_new_friendly_id?
      new_record?
    end
  end

  post = Post.create!(:title => "Hello world!")
  post.slug #=> "hello-world"
  post.title = "Hello there, world!"
  post.save!
  post.slug #=> "hello-world"

==== Locale-specific Transliterations

Active Support's +parameterize+ uses
transliterate[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-transliterate],
which in turn can use I18n's transliteration rules to consider the current
locale when replacing Latin characters:

  # config/locales/de.yml
  de:
    i18n:
      transliterate:
        rule:
          ü: "ue"
          ö: "oe"
          etc...

  movie = Movie.create! :title => "Der Preis fürs Überleben"
  movie.slug #=> "der-preis-fuers-ueberleben"

This functionality was in fact taken from earlier versions of FriendlyId.

    #
    # This method is not intended to be invoked directly; FriendlyId uses it
    # internaly to process strings into slugs.
    #
    # However, if FriendlyId's default slug generation doesn't suite your needs,
    # you can override this method in your model class to control exactly how
    # slugs are generated.
    #
    # === Example
    #
    #   class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     friendly_id :name_and_location
    #
    #     def name_and_location
    #       "#{name} from #{location}"
    #     end
    #
    #     # Use default slug, but upper case and with underscores
    #     def normalize_friendly_id(string)
    #       super.upcase.gsub("-", "_")
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   bob = Person.create! :name => "Bob Smith", :location => "New York City"
    #   bob.friendly_id #=> "BOB_SMITH_FROM_NEW_YORK_CITY"
